To create a Swarm cluster: 
Use the shell script (setup-swarm.sh) to setup a cluster with 3 nodes (1 Manager & 2 Workers)

Issue the following command to execute the script:
```
chmod +x setup-swarm.sh
./setup-swarm.sh
```
At this moment, we have 3 nodes. 

-We use an overlay network named traefik-net, on which we add the services we want to expose to Traefik.
-We use constraints to deploy the APIs on workers & Traefik on Swarm manager.
-Traefik container is configured to listen on port 80 for the standard HTTP traffic, but also exposes port 8080 for a web dashboard.
-The use of docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) allows Traefik to listen to Docker Daemon events, and reconfigure itself when containers are started/stopped.
-The label traefik.frontend.rule is used by Tr√¶fik to determine which container to use for which Request Path.
-The configs part create a configuration file for Traefik from config.toml(it enables the Docker backend)
